# Web-based Groupchat Box

## About
A groupchat web-app that allows users to chat with one another. 

I am practicing my full-stack development skills by building a messenger web-app that has full front-end and back-end functionality.

From this project, I want to learn more about full-stack development (building REST APIs, testing, database and 3rd party platform usage), get better using powerful databases like MongoDB, learn more about express and nodejs, and much more.


## Languages and Tools

This project is being developed using the MERN Stack. (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)

I've used the MERN stack before and am pretty comfortable with how it works. Since building a full-on messenger web-app is kind of challenging, I will be using various online resources to successfully build it.

Firebase will be used to host the web-app because Firebase is the best!
